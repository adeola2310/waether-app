## **Features**

### Best practices
* Added prop-types making the code easy to use and ensuring the type of data in a component are rendered correctly
* Errors were handles well
* Routes was handed properly although this is a one page app
* Codes were linted to analyze and find error in code, prettier for formatting
* Redux for state management to avoid prop drilling in app
* Ensure that I make use of code splitting to reduce load time and allowing load chunk only when the component/page is rendered or needed, Using suspense and lazy
